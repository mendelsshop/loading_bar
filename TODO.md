- more auto run functons that can have lists of colors and or texts to cycle through, that can stop at a certain point, that can take in a LoadingBar instead of creating a new one, etc
- make proper documentation on docs.rs and in the README.md
- figure out how to manage auto run functions from outside the auto run function (because of how threading works)
- change panics to Result type so that they can be handled by the user
- make a LoadingBar type struct that doesn't use crossterm for user simplicity
